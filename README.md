## Introduction

This school project is a projcet to monitor the health of a plant.
The plant will check the humidity of the soil, the amount of light, the humidity of the air and the temperature. There is also a motion sensor. This can be used when someone tries to steal your plant.
We have a solanoid valve that can water your plant automatically.
